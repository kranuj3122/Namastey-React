* CDN & why do we use ?

* development.js VS production.js (React CDN links)

* crossorigin ?

* JSX ?

Notes:
1. Order of script tag matter
2. root.render() will replace the content of root-element(<div id="root">)
3. Anything sibling to <div id="root"> remains the the same.
4. React is a library which can be applied to a small portion of a website.
